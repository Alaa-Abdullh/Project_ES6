🔹 Technologies Used:
✅ JavaScript (ES6+) – Interactive and dynamic functionality.
✅ HTML & CSS – For a visually appealing and responsive design.
✅ Local Storage – To store user login status and cart data persistently.

💡 Challenges & Learnings:
One of the biggest challenges was ensuring smooth cart functionality while maintaining performance. I optimized the event listeners and structured the JavaScript efficiently to handle user interactions seamlessly.
